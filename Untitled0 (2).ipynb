        "\n",
        "Ans1:- In Python, methods and functions have similar purposes but differ in important ways. Functions are independent blocks of code that can be called from anywhere, while methods are tied to objects or classes and need an object or class instance to be invoked\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans2:- Parameters are variables defined in a function declaration. This act as placeholders for the values (arguments) that will be passed to the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arguments are the actual values that you pass to the function when you call it. These values replace the parameters defined in the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although these terms are often used interchangeably, they have distinct roles within a function. This article focuses to clarify them and help us to use Parameters and Arguments effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans3:- Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.\n",
        "Some Benefits of Using Functions increase Code Readability ,increase Code ReusabilityBuilt-in library function: These are Standard functions in Python that are available to use.\n",
        "User-defined function: We can create our own functions based on our requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans4:- In Python (and in many other programming languages), the purpose of the return statement is to send a value back to the part of the program that called the function\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans5:- Iterable is an object, that one can iterate over. It generates an Iterator when passed to iter() method. An iterator is an object, which is used to iterate over an iterable object using the __next__() method. Iterators have the __next__() method, which returns the next item of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Every iterator is also an iterable, but not every iterable is an iterator in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a list is iterable but a list is not an iterator. An iterator can be created from an iterable by using the function iter(). To make this possible, the class of an object needs either a method __iter__, which returns an iterator, or a __getitem__ method with sequential indexes starting with 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans6:- A generator function is a special type of function that returns an iterator object. Instead of using return to send back a single value, generator functions use yield to produce a series of results over time. This allows the function to generate values and pause its execution after each yield, maintaining its state between iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans7:- On the other hand, standard functions use the return statement. They compute a value and return it at once. Generators: Use the yield statement to return values one at a time, allowing iteration over a sequence of values without storing the entire sequence in memory\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans8:- ython Lambda Functions are anonymous functions means that the function is without a name. As we already know the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python. Similarly, the lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example, we defined a lambda function(upper) to convert a string to its upper case using upper().\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans9:- The map() function is used to apply a given function to every item of an iterable, such as a list or tuple, and returns a map object (which is an iterator)\n",
        "\n",
        "s = ['1', '2', '3', '4']\n",
        "res = map(int, s)\n",
        "print(list(res))\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans10:- Essentially, these three functions allow you to apply a function across a number of iterables, in one fell swoop. map and filter come built-in with Python (in the __builtins__ module) and require no importing. reduce , however, needs to be imported as it resides in the functools module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans11:- The reduce(fun,seq) function is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along. This function is defined in “functools” module.\n",
